# 💬 Frequently Asked Questions 💬

- Is This A Virus?
> No, the program just clears your clipboard history. If it's detected as a virus
then it's a false positive. The program is 100% clean.

- Can I Use This For Commercial Use?
> To be honest I really don't care. The MIT License may say something about it
but if you want to use this at a work place or for work then go ahead.

- Is This Free To Use / Download?
> Yes! This program is completely free to use and you should not have ever
payed for this program.

- Can I Have The Source Code?
> Yes and no. I don't feel like uploading the project source code but all the
program does is "My.Computer.Clipboard.Clear()" which you can research about.

- Is The Program A Setup File?
> No. It is a standalone exe file that doesn't require you to setup and install
it. I made it this way because I'm lazy and some people just want an easy way to
clear the clipboard history.

- Can I Try To Look Into The Code?
> Usually developers will discourage reverse engineering the software they made
but that won't stop them. Go ahead and try to look into the 10+ lines of code.

- Do You Plan To Work On This Project?
> Nope. This project will probably go unmaintained as anything I can add to it
is limited. I don't plan on adding anything to the program, fixing any bugs, or even
giving help on this project. Basically discontinued but not.

- Will You Ever Remaster This Program
> Maybe. I can probably attempt to add a way to modify your clipboard and add
something to it but this would probably be a whole new repository and project.
Right now I don't want anything to do with this project as it started out as a
test project and now it will forever collect dust in this repository.
