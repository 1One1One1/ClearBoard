# Frequently Asked Questions

- Is This A Virus?
> No, the program just clears your clipboard history. If it's detected as a virus
then it's a false positive. The program is 100% clean.

- Can I Use This For Commercial Use?
> To be honest I really don't care. The MIT License may say something about it
but if you want to use this at a work place or for work then go ahead.

- Is This Free To Use / Download?
> Yes! This program is completely free to use and you should not have ever
payed for this program.

- Can I Have The Source Code?
> Yes and no. I don't feel like uploading the project source code but all the
program does is "My.Computer.Clipboard.Clear()" which you can research about.

- Is The Program A Setup File?
> No. It is a standalone exe file that doesn't require you to setup and install
it. I made it this way because I'm lazy and some people just want an easy way to
clear the clipboard history.

- Can I Try To Look Into The Code?
> Usually developers will discourage reverse engineering the software they made
but that won't stop them. Go ahead and try to look into the 10+ lines of code.
